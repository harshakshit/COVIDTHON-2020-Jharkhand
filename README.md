The current CoVid-19 (Coronavirus) outbreak has seen a heavy and quick deployment of case tracking platforms- including data visualizations from outbreaks in different countries and provinces. The testing mechanisms have been built through a network of testing laboratories that is able to track samples across the board. However, when it comes to tracking community cases and management of home based quarantines, there is limited capacities in administrations down the line to monitor, enforce and use the same. Moreover, these capacities vary greatly across states leading to poorer containment efforts in states with weaker administrative bandwidths.
